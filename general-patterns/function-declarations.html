/* Title: Function Declarations 
   Description: creating anonymous functions and assigning them to a variable
*/

// antipattern
function getData() {}


// preferred
var getData = function() { };


/* Explanation:
   advantages of using the second pattern:
   1. Makes it easier to understand "functions as an object".
   2. It enforces good semicolon habits.
   3. Doesn't have much of the baggage traditionally associated with functions and scope.
